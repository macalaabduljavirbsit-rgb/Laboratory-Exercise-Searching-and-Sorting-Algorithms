1.Why is sorting a prerequisite for efficient searching?
Sorting is like organizing your closet. Once everything is neat, 
it's WAY easier to find what you're looking for! Sorting lets you use super-fast search methods.

2.Which sorting algorithm uses a pivot?
Quick Sort picks one item as a "pivot" and then puts everything smaller on one side and everything bigger on the other.
It's like dividing a group of kids by height.

3.How does Shell Sort improve Insertion Sort?
Shell Sort is like giving Insertion Sort a head start.
It roughly sorts things first, so Insertion Sort doesn't have to work as hard in the end.

4.Give one real-world example where sorting and searching are used together.
 Think about shopping online. You search for "cheap TVs," and the website first finds all the TVs, 
then sorts them by price so you see the cheapest ones first.


5.What did you learn from comparing these algorithms?
There's no single "best" sorting method. It depends on the situation.
You have to trade off between easy-to-code, fast, and uses-little-memory.
Sorting is super important for making searching faster.
Just because one sort is "faster" in theory doesn't always mean it's faster in practice.
Even simple sorts can be improved!
