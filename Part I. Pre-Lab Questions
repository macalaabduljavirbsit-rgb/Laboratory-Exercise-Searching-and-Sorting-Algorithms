1.1What is the importance of searching in data structures?
 searching is super important because it lets you quickly find specific stuff in your data without having to look at everything


2.Why is sorting necessary before performing a binary search?
binary search only works if your stuff is organized. Imagine trying to find a specific song on your Spotify playlist,
but it's all jumbled up. Binary search needs your playlist to be in order  so it can quickly find the song you're looking for.
If it's not organized, binary search will totally fail.

3.Differentiate between linear search and binary search.
Linear Search: You check every single item in the list, one by one, until you find what you're looking for. It works no matter how the list is organized.
Binary Search: You repeatedly cut the list in half, but this only works if the list is already in order.

4.What is meant by “Divide and Conquer” in algorithms?
Divide: Break it down into smaller tasks .
Conquer: Do each of those smaller tasks.
Combine: Once you've finished all the smaller.

5.When is interpolation search more efficient than binary search?
 interpolation search is faster than binary search when your data is evenly spread out, like names in a phone book that aren't all clustered together.
